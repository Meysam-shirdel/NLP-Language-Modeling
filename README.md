</div>

Language modeling is one of the benchmark tasks of NLP. In its simplest form, it consists of predicting the most probable word following a series of words based on them. The purpose of language modeling is to create and train a model that generates a meaningful expression. In such a way that it takes an incomplete sentence and by adding words to the end of it, presents a complete and coherent sentence with a concept that can be understood.
