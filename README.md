## 1. Problem Statement
Language modeling is a fundamental task in natural language processing (NLP) that involves predicting the next word in a sequence given the preceding words. The purpose of language modeling is to create and train a model that generates a meaningful expression. In such a way that it takes an incomplete sentence and by adding words to the end of it, presents a complete and coherent sentence with a concept that can be understood.

This task is crucial for various applications, including text generation, speech recognition, machine translation, and more. Recent advances in language modeling have been driven by large-scale pre-trained models like BERT, GPT-3, and their successors. These models are trained on vast datasets and can be fine-tuned for various specific tasks, demonstrating remarkable capabilities in understanding and generating human-like text. The shift from traditional statistical models to sophisticated neural architectures has led to significant improvements in the ability of machines to understand and generate human language.
